About Trailing Interest
You may see interest on your next statement even if you pay the new balance in full and on time and make no new charges. This is called
"trailing interest". Trailing interest is the interest charged when, for example, you didn't pay your previous balance in full. When that
happens, we charge interest from the first day of the billing period until we receive your payment in full. You can avoid paying interest
on purchases by paying your balance in full (or if you have a Plan balance, by paying your Adjusted Balance on your billing statement) by
the due date each month. Please see the "When we charge interest" sub-section in your Cardmember Agreement for details.

Detail of Changes to Your Cardmember Agreement
This notice amends your Agreement as described below. Any terms and conditions in the Agreement conflicting
with these changes are completely replaced. Terms and conditions not changed by this notice continue to apply. If
you have any questions, please call the number on the back of your Card.
Effective December 1, 2022, the following updates will be made to your Agreement.
The About Plan It Feature sub-section in Part 2 of the Agreement is amended by deleting and replacing it with the
following:
About the Plan It We may offer you Plan It, which allows you to create a payment plan for qualifying
Feature purchases or a qualifying amount, subject to a plan fee. This fee is a fixed finance charge
that will be charged each month that a plan is active.
You may use this feature by selecting qualifying purchases or a qualifying amount and a
plan duration. You will be able to view the monthly plan payments, including the plan fee,
for your selection. Each plan fee will be disclosed before you create the applicable plan
and will be based on the plan duration, the APR that would otherwise apply to the
purchases or amount, and other factors. When you set up a plan, the purchases or
amount will be added to a plan balance and will be subject to a plan fee instead of the
APR for purchases.
A qualifying purchase for Plan It is a purchase of at least a specified dollar amount. A
qualifying amount for Plan It is a specified portion of your balance. Qualifying purchases
or a qualifying amount do not include purchases of cash or cash equivalents, balance
transfers (if offered), purchases subject to Foreign Transaction Fees, or any fee owed to
us, such as Annual Membership fees.
Your ability to create plans will be based on a variety of factors such as your
creditworthiness and your Credit Limit. You will not be able to create plans if your
Account is cancelled. You will also not be able to create plans if one or more of your
American Express accounts is enrolled in a payment program, or has a payment that is
returned unpaid, or is past due. We will tell you the number of active plans you may have
and we may change this number at any time. The plan durations offered to you, and your
ability to include multiple qualifying purchases or a qualifying amount in a single plan, will
be at our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors such as your
creditworthiness, the purchase amount(s), and your Account history. You agree to
manage your Account so that the total of your plan balances (including plan fees) is not
more than your Credit Limit.
Plans cannot be cancelled after they have been created but you can choose to pay them
early by paying the New Balance shown on your most recent billing statement in full. If
you pay a plan off early, you will not incur any future plan fees on that plan.

The How we apply payments and credits sub-section in Part 2 of the Agreement is amended by deleting and
replacing it with the following:
How we apply Your Account may have balances with different interest rates. For example, purchases
payments and may have a lower interest rate than cash advances. Your Account may also have Plan
credits balances which are assessed plan fees. If your Account has balances with different
interest rates, Plan balances, or plan fees, here is how we generally apply payments in a
billing period:
We apply your payments, up to the Minimum Payment Due, first to any plan
· amounts included in your Minimum Payment Due, then to the balance subject to
the lowest interest rate, and then to balances subject to higher interest rates.
After the Minimum Payment Due has been paid, we apply your payments to the
· balance subject to the highest interest rate, then to balances subject to lower
interest rates, and then to any Plan balances.
In most cases, we apply a credit to the same balance as the related charge. For
example, we apply a credit for a purchase to the purchase balance. We may apply
payments and credits within balances, and among balances with the same interest rate,
in any order we choose. If there is a negative balance in any balance on the account at
the end of a billing period, that excess credit will be redistributed to other balances in
accordance with how we apply payments described above. This means that in certain
circumstances, Plan balances may get paid before they otherwise would. If you receive a
credit for a purchase placed into a plan, you must call us at the number on the back of
your card to have the credit applied to the Plan balance.
