About Trailing Interest
You may see interest on your next statement even if you pay the new balance in full and on time and make no new charges. This is called
"trailing interest". Trailing interest is the interest charged when, for example, you didn't pay your previous balance in full. When that happens,
we charge interest from the first day of the billing period until we receive your payment in full. You can avoid paying interest on purchases by
paying your balance in full (or if you have a Plan balance, by paying your Adjusted Balance on your billing statement) by the due date each
month. Please see the "When we charge interest" sub-section in your Cardmember Agreement for details.

You may also contact us on the Web:www.americanexpress.com
In your letter, give us the following information:
- Account information: Your name and account number.

- Description of Problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and
why you believe it is a mistake. You must contact us within 60 days after the error appeared on your

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You may call us, but if you do we are
not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error, the following are true:
- We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
- The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on
that amount. But, if we determine that we made a mistake, you will not have to pay the amount in question
or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
- While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you
have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the
remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing
address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these is necessary if
your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you
the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an
ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

electronically at:
American Express, PO Box 981535, El Paso TX 79998-1535

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our
investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay
we may report you as delinquent.
