About Trailing Interest
You may see interest on your next statement even if you pay the new balance in full and on time and make no new charges. This is called "trailing
interest." Trailing interest is the interest charged when, for example, you didn't pay your previous balance in full. When that happens we charge
interest from the first day of the billing period until we receive your payment in full. You can avoid paying interest on purchases by paying your
balance in full and on time each month. Please see the "When we charge interest" sub-section in your Cardmember Agreement for details.

Detail of Change to Your Cardmember Agreement
This notice amends your American Express Cardmember Agreement ("Agreement") as described
below. Any terms in the Cardmember Agreement conflicting with this change are completely replaced.
Terms not changed by this notice continue to apply. If you have any questions, please call the

About Your Minimum Payment Due
Effective for billing periods ending on or after August 1, 2020, Part 2 of the Cardmember
Agreement is amended by deleting the How we calculate your Minimum Payment Due section and
replacing it with the following:
How we calculate To calculate the Minimum Payment Due for each billing statement, we
your Minimum start with the highest of:
Payment Due
(1) Interest charged on the billing statement plus 1% of the New Balance
(excluding any interest, penalty fees, overlimit amount, and plan
balances); or
(2) 2% of the New Balance (excluding any penalty fees, overlimit amount,
and plan balances); or
(3) $40.
Then we add any penalty fees shown on the billing statement, up to 1/24th
of any overlimit amount, any plan payment due, and any amount past due.
Your Minimum Payment Due will not exceed your New Balance. You may
pay more than the Minimum Payment Due, up to your New Balance, at
any time.
EXAMPLE: Assume that your New Balance is
$2,900, interest is $29.57, and you have no active
plans, overlimit amount, penalty fees, or amounts
past due.
(1) $29.57 + 1% multiplied by ($2,900 - $29.57) =
$58.27
(2) $58 (2% of $2,900)
(3) $40
The highest of (1), (2) or (3) is $58.27
If your account has any active plans, overlimit
amount, penalty fees, or amounts past due, your
Minimum Payment Due will be higher.
