calculate Your Due. To calculate the Pay Over Time Minimum Due for each statement, we take the higher of
Minimum (1) or (2) below, then we round that number to the nearest dollar and add any Pay Over Time
Payment Due amount past due:
(1) $35, or
(2) The amount calculated using the following EXAMPLE: Assume that you have a Pay Over
Time New Balance of $125,000, interest of
steps:
$749.59, no amounts past due and a $1,000
I.Subtract the interest charged on the
Pay In Full New Balance. Your Minimum

Balance. This gives you a Modified Pay
(1) $35, or
Over Time Balance. (2) Calculate the following:
II.Add the following together: I.$125,000 - $749.59 = $124,250.41
1% of the portion of the Modified Pay II.Add the following together:
Â·Over Time Balance less than or equal to Â·1% multiplied by $25,000 = $250.00
$25,000and Â·5% multiplied by ($75,000 - $25,000) =
$2,500.00
5% of the portion of the Modified Pay
Â·Over Time Balance greater than Â·10% multiplied by ($100,000 - $75,000) =
$2,500.00
$25,000 and less than or equal to
Â·35% multiplied by ($124,250.41 -
$75,000and
$100,000) = $8,487.64

$100,000
V.$749.59 + $13,472.10 = $14,491.69
III.Divide the sum from step II by the
Modified Pay Over Time Balance and
The higher of (1) or (2) is $14,491.69, which
round to four decimals (e.g., 0.1234) rounds to $14,492.00. The Pay Over Time
IV.Multiply the result from step III and the Minimum Payment Due of $14,492.00 plus the
