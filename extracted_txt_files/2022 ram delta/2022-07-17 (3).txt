About Trailing Interest
You may see interest on your next statement even if you pay the new balance in full and on time and make no new charges. This is called
"trailing interest". Trailing interest is the interest charged when, for example, you didn't pay your previous balance in full. When that
happens, we charge interest from the first day of the billing period until we receive your payment in full. You can avoid paying interest
on purchases by paying your balance in full (or if you have a Plan balance, by paying your Adjusted Balance on your billing statement) by
the due date each month. Please see the "When we charge interest" sub-section in your Cardmember Agreement for details.

Your Account renews next month. The following terms will be in effect when your Account renews, unless we tell
you otherwise. Please refer to Page 2 for more information about your Account, including How We

billing period. The Wall Street Journal may not publish the Prime Rate on that day. If it does not, we will use the
Prime Rate from the previous day it was published.
The Penalty APR may apply to your Account if you make one or more late payments or if your payment is
returned. We may also consider your creditworthiness in determining whether or not to apply the penalty APR to
your Account. If the Penalty APR is applied, it will apply for at least 6 months. We will review your Account every
6 months after the Penalty APR is applied. The Penalty APR will continue to apply until you have made timely
payments with no returned payments during the 6 months being reviewed.
