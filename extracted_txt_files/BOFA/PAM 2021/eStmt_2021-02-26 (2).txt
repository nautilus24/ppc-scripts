IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
BANK DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS
How to Contact Us - You may call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement.
Updating your contact information - We encourage you to keep your contact information up-to-date. This includes address,
email and phone number. If your information has changed, the easiest way to update it is by visiting the Help & Support tab of
Online Banking.
Deposit agreement - When you opened your account, you received a deposit agreement and fee schedule and agreed that your
account would be governed by the terms of these documents, as we may amend them from time to time. These documents are
part of the contract for your deposit account and govern all transactions relating to your account, including all deposits and
withdrawals. Copies of both the deposit agreement and fee schedule which contain the current version of the terms and
conditions of your account relationship may be obtained at our financial centers.
Electronic transfers: In case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers - If you think your statement or receipt is
wrong or you need more information about an electronic transfer (e.g., ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawals,
point-of-sale transactions) on the statement or receipt, telephone or write us at the address and number listed on the front of
this statement as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on
which the error or problem appeared.
- Tell us your name and account number.
- Describe the error or transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error
or why you need more information.
- Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.
For consumer accounts used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, we will investigate your complaint and will
correct any error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days (10 calendar days if you are a Massachusetts customer) (20
business days if you are a new customer, for electronic transfers occurring during the first 30 days after the first deposit is
made to your account) to do this, we will provisionally credit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will
have use of the money during the time it will take to complete our investigation.
For other accounts, we investigate, and if we find we have made an error, we credit your account at the conclusion of our
investigation.
Reporting other problems - You must examine your statement carefully and promptly. You are in the best position to discover
errors and unauthorized transactions on your account. If you fail to notify us in writing of suspected problems or an
unauthorized transaction within the time period specified in the deposit agreement (which periods are no more than 60 days
after we make the statement available to you and in some cases are 30 days or less), we are not liable to you and you agree to
not make a claim against us, for the problems or unauthorized transactions.
Direct deposits - If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least once every 60 days from the same
person or company, you may call us to find out if the deposit was made as scheduled. You may also review your activity online
or visit a financial center for information.

(Footnote 2) The Preferred Rewards for Business program is only available to Small Business, Merrill Small Business, and Bank of America
Private Bank® Small Business clients. Other categories of clients, such as those commonly referred to as Business Banking, Global Commercial
Banking, Global Corporate Investment Banking, or Institutional clients are not eligible to participate in the program. Subject to certain
exceptions, eligible business checking accounts generally are any Small Business checking account and the following Analyzed checking
accounts: Full Analysis Business Checking or Analyzed Business Interest Checking. Clients in the eligible business categories may enroll in the
program. To enroll you must have an active, eligible Bank of America business checking account, and maintain a qualifying balance of at least
$20,000 for the Gold tier, $50,000 for the Platinum tier, or $100,000 for the Platinum Honors tier in your combined qualifying Bank of
America business deposit accounts (such as checking, savings, certificate of deposit) and/or your Merrill business investment accounts (such
as Working Capital Management Accounts, Business Investor Accounts, Delaware Business Accounts). The qualifying balance is calculated
based on either (i): your average daily balance for a three calendar month period, or (ii) your current combined balance, provided that you enroll
at the time you open your first eligible business checking account and satisfy the balance requirement at the end of at least one day within
thirty days of opening that account. Refer to your Business Schedule of Fees for details on accounts that qualify towards the combined
balance calculation and receive program benefits. Eligibility to enroll is generally available three or more business days after the end of the
calendar month in which you satisfy the requirements. Bank of America Private Bank® Small Business clients are automatically enrolled in the
program at the Platinum Honors tier as long as you maintain your Bank of America Private Bank® relationship. Once you are no longer a client
of the Private Bank, your enrollment in Preferred Rewards for Business will end and the benefits from enrollment will no longer be provided.
You can continue to receive Preferred Rewards for Business benefits if you are eligible for the program and you take action to enroll. Benefits
become effective within 30 days of your enrollment, or for new accounts within 30 days of account opening, unless we indicate otherwise.
Certain benefits may be available without enrolling in the program if you satisfy balance and other requirements.
