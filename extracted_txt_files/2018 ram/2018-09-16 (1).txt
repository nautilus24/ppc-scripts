About Trailing Interest
You may see interest on your next statement even if you pay the new balance in full and on time and make no new charges. This is called "trailing
interest." Trailing interest is the interest charged when, for example, you didn't pay your previous balance in full. When that happens we charge
interest from the first day of the billing period until we receive your payment in full. You can avoid paying interest on purchases by paying your
balance in full and on time each month. Please see the "When we charge interest" sub-section in your Cardmember Agreement for details.

Information on Pay Over Time
There is no pre-set spending limit on your Card
No pre-set spending limit does not mean unlimited spending. Purchasing power adjusts with your use of the Card,
your payment history, credit record and financial resources known to us and other factors. Unless you have been
previously notified otherwise, your Card has a no pre-set spending limit.
There is a limit to your Pay Over Time feature balance
Your Pay Over Time limit is $50,000.00. We may approve or decline a charge regardless of whether your Card
account balance exceeds or does not exceed your Pay Over Time limit. You must pay in full all charges that are not
placed into a Pay Over Time balance upon receipt of your billing statement.
You are currently enrolled in the Pay Over Time feature
All of your eligible charges are automatically swept into your Pay Over Time balance. Each month you simply choose
whether to pay in full, pay the minimum due, or pay any amount in between. Interest only applies to balances not
paid in full.
